# Unity Coloring & Interaction Prototype

This repository contains a small Unity prototype created to demonstrate two core casual-game mechanics: a 2D coloring system and a simple interactive simulation. The project was built as a short technical task, focusing on clarity, responsiveness, and player feedback rather than full game scope.

The prototype includes a coloring scene where players can tap or click on outlined areas to fill them with different colors, as well as an interaction scene where the player can perform actions that trigger visual feedback and animations and the player can tracing.
